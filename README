PVGRAPH
-------

Simply utility to plot power generated by PV array.

Assumes data is stored in MySQL database by sma-bluetooth program:

  http://code.google.com/p/sma-bluetooth/

Uses the JFreeChart library to do the actual plotting:

  http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/

At the moment, compilation is by hand and you need to specify where the JFreeChart jars are located, e.g:

  javac -cp "jfreechart-1.0.13/lib/*" PVGraph.java
  
A simple shell script, pvgraph.sh, is provided to run the program - you will almost certainly need to
modify this to suit your setup.

You need to specify the username, password and url for the MySQL connection. The easiest way to do this
is to create a pvgraph.properties file in the current directory which contains these properties:

user = your username
password = your password
url = jdbc:mysql://localhost/smatool
maxpower.day = 2 (optional, sets upper limit on power axis (KW) - by default, graphs auto-scale)
