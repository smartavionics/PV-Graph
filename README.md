PVGRAPH
-------

Simply utility to plot power generated by PV array.

![sample graph](https://github.com/downloads/smartavionics/PV-Graph/20110208.png)

Assumes data is stored in MySQL database by [sma-bluetooth](http://code.google.com/p/sma-bluetooth/) program.

Uses the [JFreeChart library](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) to do the actual plotting. You need to obtain
the latest release of that library and unpack the archive in the PV-Graph source directory.

A simple Makefile is provided to build the program. It expects the JFreeChart library to be in ./jfreechart-1.0.13 so
you will need to adjust the Makefile if your setup is different.
  
A simple shell script, pvgraph.sh, is provided to run the program - you may need to modify this to suit your setup as it
needs to know where the JFreeChart jars are and also the location of mysql-connector-java.jar.

When PVGraph runs it needs a username, password and url for the MySQL connection. The easiest way to specify these
is to create a pvgraph.properties file in the current directory which contains these properties:

    user = your username
    password = your password
    url = jdbc:mysql://localhost/smatool
    
Other (optional) properties it can contain are:

    maxpower.day = NUM              # sets upper limit on power axis (KW) - by default, graphs auto-scale
    maxpower.month = NUM
    maxpower.year = NUM
    plotcolour = 0x00RRGGBB         # colour of plots for all inverters
    plotcolour.SERIAL = 0x00RRGGBB  # colour of plot for a single inverter (specified by SERIAL)

Right hand mouse button above a graph pops up a context menu, mouse scroll wheel zooms and ctrl-mousebutton pans.
